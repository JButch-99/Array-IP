## Description

_This is a project made with the fictional "Mr. Roboger" in mind. By entering a number, you will receive an series of number in the panel below. To list an example, if you enter 5: It'll count up to 5. It checks for number 1, 2, and 3. Once it detects these numbers: It'll turn the number into a string that is a word, or a question. To list from order from least to most important:_

* _1 = "Beep!"_

* _2 = "Boop!"_

* _3 = "Won't you be my neighbor?"_

_To better explain how this works, it checks which number of these three is the most important. This is important for numbers that contain multiple digits. 11 will become "Beep!", whereas 13 becomes "Won't you be my neighbor?" due to 3 taking priority of the two. For simplicity sake, this program currently limits you to the numbers 0 to 10,000 This will be expanded upon in the future._
