Describe: processArray();

// Test One
Test: "It should convert the index of an array whose highest priority number is 1, to 1."
Code:
const priorityNumbers = [1, 2, 3];
const array = [11];
processArray(array);
Expected Output: [1];

// Test Two
Test: "It should convert the index of an array whose highest priority number is 2, to 2."
Code:
const priorityNumbers = [1, 2, 3];
const array = [21];
processArray(array);
Expected Result: [2];

// Test Three
Test: "It should convert the index of an array whose highest priority number is 3, to 3."
Code:
const priorityNumbers = [1, 2, 3];
const array = [13]
processArray(array);
Expected Result: [3];

// Test Four
Test: "In indexes with 2 or more digits, it should detect priority number and have the index become that number while ignoring non-priority numbers."
Code: 
const priorityNumbers = [1, 2, 3];
const array = [18]
processArray(array);
Expected Result: [1];

// Test Five
Test: "In indexes with 2 or more digits and multiple priority numbers between 1 and 3, it should choose the greatest priority number among them."
Code:
const priorityNumbers = [1, 2, 3];
const array = [123]
processArray(array);
Expected Result: [3];

// Test Six
Test: "In index with 2 or more digits where all numbers are both priority numbers and the same value, the index will become a single number."
Code:
const priorityNumbers = [1, 2, 3];
const array = [11]
processArray(array);
Expected Result: [1];
